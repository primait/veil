A derive macro that implements [`std::fmt::Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) for a struct or enum variant, with certain fields redacted.

The purpose of this macro is to allow for easy, configurable and efficient redaction of sensitive data in structs and enum variants.
This can be used to hide sensitive data in logs or anywhere where personal data should not be exposed or stored.

# Usage

Add to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
veil = "0.1"
```

Usage documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rs/veil).

# Example

The example is explained in detail [here](https://docs.rs/veil).

```rust
#[derive(Redact)]
struct CreditCard {
    #[redact(partial)]
    number: String,

    #[redact]
    expiry: String,

    #[redact(fixed = 3)]
    cvv: String,

    #[redact(partial)]
    cardholder_name: String,
}

#[derive(Redact)]
#[redact(all, variant)]
enum CreditCardIssuer {
    MasterCard,
    Visa,
    AmericanExpress,
}

#[derive(Redact)]
#[redact(all, partial)]
struct Vehicle {
    license_plate: String,
    make: String,
    model: String,
    color: String,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Policy {
    id: Uuid,
    name: String,
    description: String,
}

#[derive(Redact)]
enum InsuranceStatus {
    #[redact(all, partial)]
    Insured {
        #[redact(fixed = 12)]
        policy: Policy,

        policy_started: String,
        policy_expires: String,

        #[redact(skip)]
        payment_card: CreditCard,

        #[redact(skip)]
        vehicles: Vec<Vehicle>,
    },

    Uninsured {
        policies_available: Vec<Policy>,
    },
}
```

# Environment Awareness

You can configure Veil to redact or skip redacting data based on environment variables. Enable the `environment-aware` Cargo feature like so in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
veil = { version = "0.1", features = ["environment-aware"] }
```

## `VEIL_DISABLE_REDACTION`

Redaction can be completely disabled by setting the `VEIL_DISABLE_REDACTION` environment variable. This is only checked once during the program lifetime for security purposes.

## `.veil.toml`

Redaction can also be configured on a per-project basis using a `.veil.toml` file. Put this file in your crate or workspace root and Veil will read it at compile time.

**Please note, if you change the file, Veil won't see the changes until you do a clean build of your crate.**

### Example

`APP_ENV` is just an example here. You can match multiple environment variables with any UTF-8 name and value(s).

```toml
[env.APP_ENV]
redact = ["production", "staging"] # redact data if "APP_ENV" is set to any of these values
skip-redact = ["dev", "qa"] # SKIP redacting data if "APP_ENV" is set to any of these values

# If "APP_ENV" isn't set or isn't recognised...
[fallback]
redact = true # do redact data (default)
# OR
redact = false # don't redact data
# OR
redact = "panic" # panic at runtime
```
